🧮 Counter 2.0

📌 Project Description:

Counter 2.0 is a simple and interactive counter application built using React.js. It allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter, while also displaying whether the current number is Even or Odd and whether it's a Prime number.
The goal of this project is to practice React hooks like useState, build logic-based UI, and apply basic mathematical operations in a user-friendly interface.

✨ Features:

➕ Increment and ➖ Decrement the count

♻️ Reset button to return count to zero

✅ Displays whether the number is Even or Odd

🔍 Checks if the number is a Prime number

🚫 Decrement button is disabled when count is 0 (no negative numbers)


⚙️ How It Works:

The component uses useState to keep track of the count.

On every change, it checks:

If the number is even or odd using count % 2

If the number is prime using a helper function isPrime(), which uses a loop till √n to check for factors.

Buttons are conditionally enabled/disabled and update the state accordingly.


🛠️ Tech Stack:

React.js (with Hooks)

CSS (for styling)
