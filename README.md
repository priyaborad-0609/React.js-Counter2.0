<h1>🧮 Counter 2.0</h1>
<h3>📌 Project Description:</h3>
<p>Counter 2.0 is a simple and interactive counter application built using React.js. It allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter, while also displaying whether the current number is Even or Odd and whether it's a Prime number.
The goal of this project is to practice React hooks like useState, build logic-based UI, and apply basic mathematical operations in a user-friendly interface.</p>
<br>
<h1>✨ Features:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>➕ Increment and ➖ Decrement the count</li>
  <li>✅ Displays whether the number is Even or Odd</li>
  <li>🔍 Checks if the number is a Prime number</li>
  <li>🚫 Decrement button is disabled when count is 0 (no negative numbers)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h1>⚙️ How It Works:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The component uses useState to keep track of the count.</li>
  <li>On every change, it checks:</li>
  <li>If the number is even or odd using count % 2</li>
  <li>If the number is prime using a helper function isPrime(), which uses a loop till √n to check for factors.</li>
  <li>Buttons are conditionally enabled/disabled and update the state accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h1>🛠️ Tech Stack:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>React.js (with Hooks)</li>
  <li>CSS (for styling)</li>
</ul>
